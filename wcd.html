<h6>Participants in the Warfighter-Centered Design class doing an affinity diagramming module to help categorize and organize their divergent thinking results.</h6>
<h3>“Now -- go innovate.”</h3>
<p>If you’re motivated by that order, but not yet sure where to start, this course is for you.</p>
<p>Warfighter-Centered Design gives any Marine the basic tools for solving problems that matter: how to find opportunities, build buy-in among the Marines closest to the problem, share opportunities to design solutions, and brief a way ahead to decisionmakers. We cover the tactics, techniques, procedures, and tools of creative problem-solving, marrying the best of civilian practice with the tried-and-true lessons of Marine Corps doctrine.</p>
<h4>This isn’t just a classroom course. CAW graduates are expected to make a difference, and we train like we fight.</h4>
<p>Participants spend the first day in a workshop facilitated by Center for Adaptive Warfighting staff, the second day using those new skills to facilitate a workshop for junior Marines, and a third day learning how to draw lessons from the workshops and turn them into actionable projects. We cover how to win a crowd; divergent (creative) and convergent (practical) thinking; earning buy-in; prioritizing projects that make a difference; how to plan and brief the resulting projects; and how it all fits in with Marine Corps doctrine and other planning tools. Once the classroom learning’s done, participants head back to their units and conduct a workshop of their own on a problem of their or their command’s choice. After-Actions are collected and displayed by the Center for Adaptive Warfighting.</p>
