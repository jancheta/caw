<h6>Participants in the Military Scrum Master course work on backlog refinement to better understand the scrum framework.</h6>
<h3>Tired of wasting time on work that doesn’t matter?</h3>
<p>Or redoing projects over and over because expectations weren’t clear? Maybe you’d like to help your team do twice as much work in half the time? Scrum is the class for you.</p>
<p>Agile Scrum is a tool for running teams of 3-9 people. Scrum is adapted from the civilian world of software development, where it’s seen widespread success and is practiced by companies from Amazon to Starbucks. This version of Scrum entered the military through the commander of a Navy EOD unit, which practiced Scrum while undertaking missions around the world, seeing a <b>40% decrease in the amount of email they had to handle, and a 1,250% increase in how much they were able to do each week. (That’s not a typo.)</b> Scrum combines a heads-up display, so that your team can see, prioritize, and track the work it needs to do; a social compact, so that everyone understands what they needs to do to keep the team moving; and regular conversations with the people who depend on you, so that you can figure out what you’re doing right, what you can do better, and what you don’t need to do at all – and pivot smoothly when conditions change.</p>
<p>This course lasts two days, in which you’ll learn everything you need in order to implement Scrum at your home unit.</p>
